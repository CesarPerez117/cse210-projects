Meaning of Encapsulation
    Encapsulation is one of the core principles of object-oriented. It means building the data (fields) and methods that operate on that data into a single unit called class, while restricting
direct access to the internal details. Basically, it will keep your variables that keep the data private and untouchable from outside, making sure not other than the internal functions will 
make changes and use their collected data.

Benefit of Encapsulation
    Encapsulation protects the integrity of the data by preventing outside code from making uncontrolled changes. It also makes programs easier to maintain and interact, since the internal
implementation can change without affecting how other parts of the program interact with the class. 

Application of Encapsulation
    For example, in a banking system, you don't want anyone directly changing an account balance. Instead, you provide controlled methods like deposit and withdraw that enforce rules such also
no overdraft or no negative deposits. So the balance would be private, meaning no external code can directly modify it. But the functions deposit and withdraw will act as controlled gateways,
ensuring only valid operations are performed, making sure the data is updated properly, so then it will change the balance base on the operation requested.

Code example of Encapsulation from the program you wrote.
public class Fraction
{
    private int _top;
    private int _bottom;
    // the variables are private, so they cannot be changed for other than the internal functions (methods).
   
    public Fraction(int top, int bottom)
    {  // this is the constructor that will make sure the data is get and set to be used and returned just for internal functions (methods)
        _top = top;
        _bottom = bottom;
    }
    
    public string GetFractionString()
    {  // this will provide the class that is requesting access and interaction to display the information they entered and interacted with.
        string fractionString = $"{_top}/{_bottom}";
        return fractionString;
    }

}

Thoroughly explain these concepts. -> Done.
