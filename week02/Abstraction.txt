Articulate the principle of abstraction.

1- Explain the meaning of Abstraction: Abstraction means focusing on what something does, not how it does it. 
So we will be hiding the complicated details of how the things work and we will just show what is important.
If we consider a car as the object, the car is made of diferent components such as motor, transmission or drivetrain.
Each of this compents is made of diferent pieces, materials and make a specific function. So with abstraction, we make
sure that we just show the most simple things, like this is a car, that has components, they work together to make the car 
functional and drivable, with not showing 6 years of mechanic ingeneering to the user. 

2- Highlight a benefit of Abstraction: If you change how data is stored inside a class, other classes don’t need 
to be updated because they only interact with the public methods.

3- Provide an application of Abstraction: Every time that we decide to take an instance of an object that hides the internal
funcionality, This means we can call a method without rewriting all the underlying code each time. For example, in Python we 
use print() to display text. We don’t need to know how the operating system handles the console output; we just call print() 
and it works.

4- Use a code example of Abstraction from the program you wrote.

A class Resume needs to have the previuos experience of the individaul.
This means that we need to enter the Jobs he has been in. If we create a 
class that just keeps this records to display it in a certain way instead 
of writing in every time, this will be: 
public class Job
{
    public string _jobTitle;
    public string _company;
    public int _startYear;
    public int _endYear;

    public void Display()
    {
        Console.WriteLine($"{_jobTitle} ({_company}) {_startYear}-{_endYear}");
    }
}

Then, in the main, we can add the info required, and display it as we want:
Job job1 = new Job();
        job1._jobTitle = "Scheduler Agent";
        job1._company = "Solar City";
        job1._startYear = 2021;
        job1._endYear = 2023;

job1.Display(); 

and the output will be: 

Scheduler Agent (Solar City) 2021-2023


5- Thoroughly explain these concepts: Well, I may repeat myself I believe but... I can say that abstraction means focusing on 
what something does, not how it does it. It hides complicated details and shows only what is important. For example, a car has 
many complex parts like the engine and transmission, but as drivers we only see simple controls. A benefit of abstraction is 
that if the way data is stored inside a class changes, other classes don’t need to be updated because they only interact with 
public methods.
